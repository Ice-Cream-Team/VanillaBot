**To boot up the bot for hosting** (note: you'll need the bot's private token to run this):
```
# By default, it will look for the token from a file called "tokenfile". There should be no extra whiteline characters (e.g. newlines, tabs, spaces, etc.) in the file!
$ npm start 

# You can also specify the tokenfile.
$ npm start -- --tokenfile <different token file>

# Finally, you can directly use the token.
$ npm start -- --token <token>
```

**To exit your hosting** of the bot press: 'Control' + 'C' in your terminal session while running the bot
